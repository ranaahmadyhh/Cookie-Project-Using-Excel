# 🍪 Kevin's Cookie Company Data Analysis 📊

Welcome to the data analysis project using the **Kevin Cookie Company Dataset**! In this project, I used **Excel** to clean, filter, format, and perform calculations on the data. I then created **pivot tables** and **pivot charts** to summarize key metrics and visualize the performance of the business.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Excel**: For data cleaning, formatting, and applying formulas
- **Pivot Tables**: For summarizing data in meaningful ways
- **Pivot Charts**: For visualizing key metrics such as revenue, units sold, and profit margin

## 📈 Visualizations

Here are the three key visualizations I created:

1. **Total Revenue by Country 🌍**  
   This chart shows the total revenue generated by the company, broken down by country. It's a great way to understand which regions contribute the most to the company's income.

2. **Total Units Sold by Product 🍪**  
   This visual summarizes the total number of units sold for each product. It helps in identifying the best-selling products and understanding product performance.
